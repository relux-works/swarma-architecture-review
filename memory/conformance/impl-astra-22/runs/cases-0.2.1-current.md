# astra-22 vector results

Package: **0.2.1-draft**, package commit `f31d58f58d05de2ae4159dedaacfa1e32bdc656d`.
Vector directory: `memory/conformance/cases` (this inventory only).
Checkout: `c923ebd0a1b3842b3ff597a8b559008bcf5d6138`. Source core SHA-256: `bd0f09fd93fa4d82af6ac5ec4338bd9dec05fde32ddd82262c73df2369224550`.

The core is source-derived; the original frozen run is preserved under runs/0.1.0-first.*.
Judge-classified corrections are recorded in DIVERGENCES.md; the adapter is an independent wire mapping.
Every vector was loaded. Unsupported is neither a pass nor evidence of a package defect.
Deployment cases require actual boundary qualification and are reported separately.

| Category | Pass | Fail | Unsupported |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| semantic | 14 | 0 | 8 |
| deployment | 0 | 0 | 1 |

Five bounded harness controls passed (valid comparison, changed value, extra field,
handle reuse, forbidden predicate). Only declared handle paths are normalized;
handle length, equality, distinctness and paired-output invariants are checked.
No randomness-distribution or timing proof is claimed.

| Vector | Category | Result | Evidence / reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ASTRA24-04 | semantic | pass | Exact report and forbidden/normalization checks passed. |

| ASTRA24-05 | semantic | pass | Exact report and forbidden/normalization checks passed. |
| ASTRA24-01 | semantic | unsupported | Frozen core has no exact proof-path enumeration or changes output |
| ASTRA24-02 | semantic | pass | Exact report and forbidden/normalization checks passed. |
