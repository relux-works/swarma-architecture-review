# astra-22 vector results

Package: **0.2.3-draft**, package commit `23290b3a96a469d5190cb71b0e20139896b89236`.
Vector directory: `memory/spec/kernel/vectors` (this inventory only).
Checkout: `97990250ecd826ee6dee5ba0aba0543e7981ca1d`. Source core SHA-256: `7e0895bb74bd63a469ddc46ce25db7a6f110c2c0767a53ebacdddeb7875ab256`.

The core is source-derived; the original frozen run is preserved under runs/0.1.0-first.*.
Judge-classified corrections are recorded in DIVERGENCES.md; the adapter is an independent wire mapping.
Every vector was loaded. Unsupported is neither a pass nor evidence of a package defect.
Deployment cases require actual boundary qualification and are reported separately.

| Category | Pass | Fail | Unsupported |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| semantic | 49 | 0 | 8 |
| deployment | 0 | 0 | 8 |

Five bounded harness controls passed (valid comparison, changed value, extra field,
handle reuse, forbidden predicate). Only declared handle paths are normalized;
handle length, equality, distinctness and paired-output invariants are checked.
No randomness-distribution or timing proof is claimed.
